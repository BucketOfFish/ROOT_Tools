### Merging Ntuples

use makeFileHaddTemplate.C to create a template ntuple (full tree with 0 entries) that goes in front of the hadd command.  The 'sourceFile' in this script should point to an ntuple that contains the full set of branches, e.g. ttbar.

Then use mergeFiles.py in a folder where you've downloaded all of the grid jobs.  'haddTemplate' in this script should point to the output of makeFileHaddTemplate.C

*Note* the template functionality has only been tested locally, not on everything
